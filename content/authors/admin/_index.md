I am a Lecturer at Computer Science and Informatics Division, London South Bank University, carrying out research and teaching activities in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. Prior to this, I was a post-doctoral research fellow in the Computer Science Department at the University of Bristol. 

I obtained my PhD in Engineering (Intelligent Systems) from the University of Warwick under the supervision of Prof Robert Harrison, and my MSc in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics) from Izmir Institute of Technology under the supervision of Prof. M. I. Can Dede. 

My research focuses on developing methodologies that enable the creation of robust, self-adaptive and self-optimised cyber-physical production systems; specially concentrating on: management of complexity, changes and disturbances in complex production systems, intelligent manufacturing processes and systems, bio-intelligent and bio-inspired manufacturing, industrial robotics, holonic and agent-based manufacturing, distributed production systems, digital factories, modelling and optimisation of production processes and chains, production planning and control, machine learning techniques, ANNs, hybrid AI techniques and their technical and business applications.

I had worked as a co-investigator and researcher on several industrial projects, including Knowledge-Driven Configurable Manufacturing (KDCM) and Thales-Bristol Partnership in Hybrid Autonomous Systems Engineering (TB-PHASE), in collaboration with several manufacturers from aerospace, automotive and defence industries. I have published several peer-reviewed academic journal articles and conference proceedings on reputable academic journals and conferences such as Journal of Manufacturing Systems and CIRP CMS. In the last five years, I have won several awards and scholarships, including 2016 Best Paper Award at CIRP Conference on Assembly Systems and Technologies held in Gothenburg, Sweden.
